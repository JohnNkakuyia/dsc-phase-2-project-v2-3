## Project Overview

This project aims to provide actionable insights to a leading real estate firm in King County, Washington. We focus on refining property appraisals by analyzing key attributesâ€”number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and housing condition. Our goal is to understand how strategic home renovations influence property values, arming the agency with tools to guide homeowners effectively. Through a comprehensive analysis of factors affecting home prices in the region, we aim to equip the firm with valuable resources for informed decision-making in the dynamic real estate market, covering aspects like buying, selling, and renovations. This project establishes a systematic methodology to optimize clients' return on investment amid the complexities of the local real estate landscape.

### Business Problem

The real estate agency aims to provide homeowners with strategic advice on optimizing property values based on key features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and housing condition. Currently, there is a lack of a systematic approach to offer informed recommendations, limiting homeowners' ability to enhance their return on investment during property sales. The agency seeks to develop a structured methodology to assess and communicate how specific features, particularly the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and housing condition, influence property prices. This approach will empower the agency to guide clients effectively in making renovations that align with market demands, thereby maximizing the overall value of their properties.
